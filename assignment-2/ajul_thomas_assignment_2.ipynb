    "We have a company with 80 employees and 50 departments. Each department receives certain types of job requests from clients. Fast processing of job requests is important for customer retention. As such, we need to find the optimal assignment of the employees to the departments to minimise the average time a client waits before their job requests are finished. Also, to avoid poor reviews from angry clients, we need to minimise the maximum time any client might have to wait before their jobs are finished.\n",
